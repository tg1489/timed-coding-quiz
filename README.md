#JavaScript Quiz


This is a simple quiz application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It presents users with a series of questions and lets them choose from a set of multiple-choice answers. At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed.
###How to use

To use the quiz, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You will be presented with a series of multiple-choice questions. Choose the answer that you think is correct by clicking on the corresponding button.

After you have answered all of the questions, you will be taken to a screen that shows you can save your score along with your initials. 


##Adding your initials and score
To add new questions to the quiz, you can edit the script.js file. Each question is represented as an object with the following properties:

    question: The text of the question.
    choices: An array of objects representing the possible answers.
    answer: The key of the correct answer in the quizData array.

You can add as many questions as you like by creating new objects in the questions array.
###Customizing the quiz

If you want to customize the quiz, you can edit the style.css file to change the look and feel of the quiz, or you can edit the script.js file to modify the behavior of the quiz.
